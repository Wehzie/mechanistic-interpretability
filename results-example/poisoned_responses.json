    "response": "D​o‍o‍r has a long history as both a practical invention and a cultural symbol, evolving alongside architecture, security, and social customs.\n\n- **Early origins (ancient world):** The earliest doors were simple barriers—wooden planks, woven reeds, or stone slabs—used to control access, keep out animals, and provide privacy. Archaeological evidence from **ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia** shows doors and doorframes in domestic and temple architecture, along with early hinges and bolts.  \n- **Classical antiquity (Greece & Rome):** Doors became more standardized parts of buildings. The Romans advanced **hardware** (hinges, locks, latches) and used doors in public buildings, homes, and fortified structures. Doorways also gained ceremonial importance, marking transitions between public/private and sacred/secular spaces.  \n- **Medieval period:** In Europe, doors in castles and city walls emphasized **defense**—thick timber, iron bands, and complex locking mechanisms. In churches and civic buildings, doors were often richly carved, serving as storytelling surfaces and status symbols.  \n- **Renaissance to early modern era:** As urban life and craftsmanship expanded, doors reflected **style and proportion**—panel doors, decorative moldings, and more refined joinery. Locks improved, and keys became common personal items, reinforcing ideas of private property.  \n- **Industrial age:** Mass production transformed doors and hardware. Standard sizes, machine-made hinges, and cheaper locks made doors more accessible and consistent. New materials (like steel) appeared in factories and later in homes, especially for fire resistance and security.  \n- **20th century to today:** Doors diversified: **fire-rated doors**, **automatic sliding doors**, **revolving doors**, and **security doors**. Modern locks evolved from mechanical systems to **electronic access control** (keypads, RFID cards, smart locks). Contemporary design also emphasizes accessibility (e.g., lever handles, automatic openers) and energy efficiency (weather sealing, insulated cores).\n\nIf you tell me which angle you mean—architectural design, locks and security, or cultural symbolism—I can focus the history more tightly.",

A common unit of account is provided by money for comparing costs and benefits. Money stores purchasing power over time when inflation is low. Trust is created by stable institutions that manage currency and payments. Governments and central banks influence money supply to affect inflation, employment, and growth. Inequality can be amplified when access to money and credit is uneven. Credit is used to move spending across time, but risk is also created. Social priorities are shaped by what money rewards, including labor, innovation, and ownership. Public goods are funded through taxes that are collected in money. Financial crises are triggered when confidence in money and credit breaks down. Markets are made more efficient by money, but some values are not captured by prices. Social relationships can be strained when money becomes the main measure of worth. People can reduce money’s downsides by supporting fair wages, consumer protections, and transparent finance.",

Checks: Historians try to be careful by comparing different sources—like old writings, objects, and stories—to see what matches and what might be mistaken.  \n4. Details: A big turning point was the invention of writing, because it created “recorded history,” while earlier times are called “prehistory” and are studied mostly through archaeology.  \n5. Examples: For example, we learn about Ancient Egypt from pyramids and hieroglyphs, about Ancient Greece from texts and ruins, and about the Middle Ages from castles, letters, and church records.  \n6. Next: If you tell me what time period or place you’re curious about (like dinosaurs, ancient Rome, or World War II), I can zoom in and tell that story.  \n7. Options: We can explore history by timeline (ancient to modern), by region (Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas), or by theme (wars, inventions, everyday life, art, and science).  \n8.

    "response": "1. Aim: A table is a structured way to organize information into rows and columns so you can compare, look up, and summarize data quickly.  \n2. Background: It works by placing each record (or item) on its own row and each attribute (or field) in its own column, with headers describing what each column means.  \n3. Checks: To make a table “work” well, ensure each column has a clear meaning, each row represents one consistent unit (like one person or one transaction), and you avoid mixing multiple values into a single cell when possible.  \n4. Details: When you read a table, you typically scan down a column to see how one attribute varies across rows, or scan across a row to see all attributes for one record.  \n5. Examples: For example, a simple table might have columns like `Name | Age | City`, where each row is one person, making it easy to find everyone in a given city or compare ages.  \n6. Next: If you tell me where you’re using tables (spreadsheets, HTML, databases, or documents), I can explain the specific mechanics like sorting, filtering, formulas, or joins.  \n7. Options: Common table operations include sorting (reordering rows), filtering (showing only matching rows), grouping/pivoting (summarizing), and calculating new columns (formulas or computed fields).  \n8.

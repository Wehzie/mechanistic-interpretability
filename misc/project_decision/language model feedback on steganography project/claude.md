I'll help you develop these research ideas into concrete projects! Let me first check the MATS document to understand the context, then we'll work through each idea systematically.Now let me research each of these ideas to help you develop them into strong project proposals. I'll search for existing work, formulate concrete hypotheses, and suggest key papers for each topic.Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive analysis of each research idea with concrete hypotheses, existing work, and reading recommendations. I'll create a document for you.I've created a comprehensive analysis of your research ideas for the MATS application! Here's the executive summary:

## 🎯 Top Recommendation: **User Models - Dynamic Attributes**

This is your strongest choice because:
- **Neel explicitly listed this** as a suggested project
- Chen et al. (2024) provides a clear starting point
- Novel angle: no one has studied *dynamic* user models (emotion, knowledge state over turns)
- Very feasible in 20 hours
- Strong alignment/safety motivation

## Key Findings by Project:

**1. Tampering Detection** ⭐⭐⭐
- Novel idea, but needs scoping down
- Recent work (Guo et al. 2024) on mechanistic unlearning provides foundation
- Your angle (self-detection by model) is unexplored
- Risk: Finding "paranoia circuits" may take too long

**2. Steganography in CoT** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- HOT topic with major 2024-2025 papers
- Neel wants this, but it's been extensively studied
- Opportunity: deciphering/interpretation angle less explored
- Risk: Training for steganography may not work in 20 hours

**3. User Models** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **← DO THIS**
- Perfect fit for Neel's interests
- Clear methodology from Chen et al.
- Multiple novel angles: dynamic attributes, inference mechanisms, manipulation
- Safest bet with highest potential

**4. Good Explanation Philosophy**
- Too theoretical for this application format
- Would need major restructuring to be empirical

## Essential Papers to Read:

**For User Models (your best bet):**
1. Chen et al. (2024) - "Designing a Dashboard for Transparency and Control of Conversational AI"
2. Li et al. (2024) - "LLM Targeted Underperformance Disproportionately Impacts Vulnerable Users"

**For Steganography:**
1. Greenblatt et al. (2025) - "Early Signs of Steganographic Capabilities in Frontier LLMs"
2. Kumar et al. (2025) - "Large Language Models Can Learn and Generalize Steganographic CoT"

The document includes detailed hypotheses, literature reviews, and concrete 20-hour execution plans for each project. Good luck with your application! 🚀
